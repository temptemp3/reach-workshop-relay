/*
 * 1. Problem Analysis
 * Who are the principals of the application?
 * 1) Alice, who sends funds
 * 2) Bob, who receives funds
 * Who are the participants of the program?
 * 1) Alice, who initiates the application, and
 * 2) the Relay, which transfers funds to Bob
 * â€» Bob is not a participant
 * What information do they know at the start of the program?
 * 1) Alice knows amt 2) Bob knows nothing
 * What information are they going to discover and use in the program?
 * 1) Alice will disover RA 2) Bob will discover RA secret
 * What funds change ownership during the application and how?
 * 1) Alice creates the Relay acc, while the Relay learns the address of Bob, who will receive teh funds
 * 2) Funds move from Alice to Bob through Relay
 * 2. Data Definition
 * Alice: amt, getRelay
 * Relay: getBob
 * 3. Communication Construction
 * 1) Alice pays amount and says who the Relay is
 * 2) Consensus remembers Relay
 * 3) Relay publish who Bob is
 * 4) Consensus pays Bob
 * 4. Assertion Insertion
 * 5. Interaction Introduction
 * 6. Deployment Decisions
